# Interpretable ML based algorithms in Cardiac Anomaly Detection
# The goal of this project is to create a model that makes ML model more understandable for users. 


# From File --> Code --> 'requirements.txt', install libraries and requirments
# From File --> Code --> 'run.py', choose one of files (df_rest, df_stress), run code
# All results automatically save in Results and pkl_files
# To have SHAP plot, use interpretability file. 
# Give the path of train and test .csv files in interpretability file.
# Give the path of .pkl file of specific model that is required to be interpreted. 
# See the SHAP plots in Results folder
